### Part 2 (75 pts)

*Initial Discovery Actions*

  After initial discovery of the security vulnerabilities, the first option would be to report the vulnerability through
  the appropriate company vulnerability reporting channels. In the company report, all information regarding the
  vulnerability, how to recreate it, and recommendations for its solution would be documented. However, not all
  companies currently have vulnerability reporting methods, if that is the case informing a supervisor or
  person in charge would be the wisest course of action. It is imperative to ensure that all information
  regarding the discovery and reporting of the vulnerability is formally documented and retained.
 
*How far should I go?*
 
  If I were the firmware auditor, in my opinion, my responsibility would end here. I would ensure that I kept
  the documentation of my reporting the issue and ensure that I remain informed about the
  course of action the company is following regarding the vulnerability. I would not attempt to
  force the company to act in a manner that I personally deemed a responsible course of action through public
  reporting or whistleblowing. I believe this is highly irresponsible on my part because if the information were
  to be publicly released it is possible that an attacker who had no previous knowledge of the information would exploit
  it. This could cause immense harm to others. Also, this would leave me open to lawsuits from not only the company
  but also by customers that have been affected. However, if I were concerned the company was acting
  unethically regarding this vulnerability I would immediately consult a lawyer to determine the best course of action
  from there.
 
  Others might not agree that this is the best course of action because I am not willing to go
  public with the vulnerability information to prevent harm to customers. However, going public comes with a 100
  percent guarantee that attackers would know about and exploit the vulnerability.
  It is also possible that regardless of the information being made public, the company does not feel compelled
  to fix the issue. It is also arguable that even if the information was made public, either by me or the
  company, that customers do not ensure their vehicle's computer is patched and/or updated properly which still leaves
  customers vulnerable.
 
*Responsiblity of harm*

  If the company did nothing to ensure that lives were not at risk because of the vulnerability after my report, I
  would not feel that I was responsible. If I had done everything within my ability to ensure the vulnerability was
  repaired, responsibility should not fall on my shoulders because the company refused to take action. 
  I would only feel responsible for any harm done if I never reported or attempted to hide the information from the
  company. Responsibility for any harm caused by the vulnerability should fall to me because it's nearly impossible
  for a company to address a vulnerability if they never learn of its existence.
 
  However, not everyone would agree. It is possible that others would still hold me responsible for not forcing the
  company, by any means necessary, to act on the vulnerability.  Since many companies are not willing to publicly
  disclose information either for public relations purposes or intellectual property issues, they are left to handle
  security vulnerabilities as they see fit. Many, not all, companies will not address security issues until the public
  is made aware of them to avoid having to pay the cost of fixing the issue. However, it should not be the
  responsibility of one employee to hold a company accountable. It is up to the state and federal governments to
  enact laws that hold companies accountable to prevent, report, and fix security vulnerabilities.
